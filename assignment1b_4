THIS IS A METRO PROJECT IN CPP , CREATED UISNG SEVERAL GRAPH ALGORITHMS LIKE DIJISKTRA , FLLOYD WARSHALL .
>> THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM FOLLOWS THE WORKFLOW FROM USER DATA MANAGEMENT TO OFFERING DIFFERENT PATH ALTRENATIVES TO THE USER FOR THE DESTINATION TO CALCULATE DISTANCE AND COST TRAVERSAL 
>> THE DATA OF USER IS MANAGED BY FIRST ALLOWING USER TO SIGN UP , WHICH IS HERE STORED THROUGH FILE HANDLING , SIGNED USERS CAN ALSO LOGIN USING USERID  AND PASSWORD. IN THIS PROCESS , MACHINE ALLOTS - METRO CARD , USER ID , PASSWORD BY U  
>>USER ID IS BEING DYNAMICALLY  GENERATED WITH THE HELP OF SUPERSTINGIFY THE NAME AND PASSWORD OF THE USER BY USING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMMING .
>> AFTER LOGING IN , the program shows all the stations and ask user source and destination .
>> AFTER THIS , USER GIVE 5 ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR THE PATH , 
  >> TO SHOW ALL THE PATHS FOR THE SPECIFIC SOURCE - DESTINATION PAIR
  - THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED USING BASIC DFS AND STORING ALL THE PATHS 
  >>TO SHOW THE PATH COMPRISING MINIMUM NUMBER OF STATIONS 
  >>TO SHOW THE PATH COMPRISE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STATIONS .
   - BOTH OFFERS ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH SORTING THE ARRAY PATH THAT WAS FOUND WHILE FINDING ALL PATHS 
  >>TO SHOW THE SHORTEST DISTANCE PATH 
  - THIS IS IMPLEMENTED USING DIJISKTRA ALGORITHM IN WHICH GREEDY APPROACH IS BEING USED TO FIND THE PATH HAVING SHORTEST DISTANCE 
  >> TO SHOW THE PATH VIA PARTICULAR STATION 
  - THIS IS IMPLEMENTED USING SAME ARRAY BUT BY APPLYING CERTAIN CONDITIONS .
>> AFTER THAT , THE MACHINE IS CALCULATING THE PRIZE , UPDATING THE BALANCE OF METRO CARD AND YES THAT SIT;
